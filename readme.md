# :zap: Bolt - Opinionated React Templates

Bolt is a set of opinionated react bootstrap templates that make it easy to start any new project.
Stop spending hours configuring the same old libraries, and get started sooner.

All features are optional, so chop and change whatever library you like.

**React** <br/>
**React-Router** - üå¥ For fast reactive routing. <br/>
**Typescript** - ü¶æ For strong typing support. <br/>
**ParcelJS** - ‚ú® Fast bundling, dev server, PostCSS support + more. <br/>
**Recoil** - ü™ê For fast, dynamic state management. <br/>
**Hoofd** - ü§Ø For simple, hook-based head management. <br/>
**React Final Form** - ü•ä Super fast form management. <br/>
Presets for Prettier, ESLint, PostCSS. <br/>

Plus support for Firebase or GraphQL via the flavours below.

## Pre-Built Features

1.  Simple file structure - based on hooks, pages, atoms, components & logic.
